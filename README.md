# Advanced EDA & Feature Engineering on E-Commerce Orders Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on transforming raw and incomplete e-commerce transaction data into a clean, reliable, and machine-learning-ready dataset. The workflow includes missing value treatment, outlier detection and handling, feature engineering, and statistical analysis using Python-based data science tools.

The final dataset is optimized for predictive analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning applications.



## Project Objectives

* Handle missing values using Mean, Mode, and KNN Imputation techniques.
* Detect and treat outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
* Engineer meaningful predictive features from existing attributes.
* Perform statistical analysis and exploratory data preparation.
* Generate a clean dataset suitable for machine learning models.



## Business Problem

E-commerce datasets often contain missing values, inconsistencies, and extreme observations that can negatively impact data analysis and machine learning model performance.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a complete preprocessing pipeline that converts raw transactional data into a high-quality dataset suitable for predictive modeling and business intelligence applications.

## Data Preprocessing

### Missing Value Treatment

The dataset contained missing values in both categorical and numerical features. Multiple imputation techniques were applied to improve data quality.

#### Mean Imputation

Applied to numerical columns where missing values were replaced with the average value of the respective feature.

Examples:

* Quantity
* UnitPrice

Mean imputation helps preserve the overall distribution of numerical data.

Example:

```python
df["Quantity"] = df["Quantity"].fillna(
    df["Quantity"].mean()
)
`

#### Mode Imputation

Applied to categorical columns:

* CouponCode
* PaymentMethod

Mode imputation replaces missing values with the most frequently occurring category.

Example:

```python
df["CouponCode"] = df["CouponCode"].fillna(
    df["CouponCode"].mode()[0]
)


#### KNN Imputation

Applied to numerical columns:

* Quantity
* UnitPrice
* ItemsInCart
* TotalPrice

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputer estimates missing values using similar observations in the dataset.

```python
imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
```

KNN imputation preserves relationships between variables and often produces more accurate estimates than simple statistical methods.



## Outlier Detection and Treatment

Outliers were identified and treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

### Formula

IQR = Q3 − Q1

Lower Bound = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR

Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR

Values outside the acceptable range were capped to reduce the influence of extreme observations while maintaining data integrity.

### Benefits

* Reduces noise in the dataset
* Improves model performance
* Prevents skewed statistical results
* Enhances prediction accuracy


## Feature Engineering

To improve predictive capability, several new features were generated.

### RevenuePerItem

Measures revenue generated per item sold.

```python
RevenuePerItem = TotalPrice / Quantity
```

### AverageCartValue

Represents the average monetary value of products in a shopping cart.

```python
AverageCartValue = TotalPrice / ItemsInCart
```

### CouponUsed

Binary feature indicating whether a coupon was applied.

```python
1 = Coupon Used
0 = Coupon Not Used


### OrderMonth

Extracted from the Date column to capture seasonal purchasing patterns.

### OrderYear

Extracted from the Date column to support long-term trend analysis.



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The preprocessing pipeline enables further exploratory analysis, including:

* Sales Distribution Analysis
* Product Popularity Analysis
* Coupon Usage Trends
* Payment Method Preferences
* Customer Purchasing Behavior
* Cart Value Distribution

## Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were generated to understand the overall distribution of data.

Metrics analyzed:

* Mean
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Minimum and Maximum Values
* Quartiles
* Dataset Summary Statistics

Example:

```python
df.describe()




## Machine Learning Readiness

After preprocessing, the dataset satisfies key machine learning requirements:

* No critical missing values
* Reduced outlier influence
* Enhanced feature set
* Improved consistency
* Better predictive capability

The final dataset can be directly used for:

* Classification Models
